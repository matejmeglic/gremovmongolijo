Sleeping in the tent ends with first sunbeams. Quality of sleep depends on nightly visits we have had and loud music that comes from all around us.

We set ourselves a dining room with biggest windows and the most beautiful view on the lake and misty Mountains of Heaven as they are called here. Nearby bushes are our bathroom and because it is Saturday, we are cleaning just as we would do it at home. Back seats were in pain when we started and after an hour or so, our Beast was starting to look more livable. Proud on our achievements, we rest immediately.

First swimmers are already coming around our "garden" while we're sitting in the shade, and in the sun, exchanging seats repetitively. We read books, yes real books, write blog and photo. Battery in our laptop is calling for refill when Matej finishes for last dot in our Siol's article. Next, on our hunt for internet. We are lucky, we find it soon in a wooden house that is a local tavern. We deserve pizza today, and we really are. We are waiting a good hour for it, and it looked like a dove just made with one tomato and two slices of cheese, covered with random vegetables.We listen to people at other tables talking about Slovenia and The Car.

Just before we leave, our bartender finds courage and asks us where are we from and why are we on this course, staying in Kyrgyzstan. We tell him about the project and he is amazed. He is constantly asking Matej more and more. His name is Timur and he comes from Tashkent in Uzbekistan, is 18 years old and came to help his aunt during turist season. He would like to see the world but he struggles with money and low possibilities for receiving a visa. On our way back to beaches we found a doctor from Bishkek who is interested in spreading this project to Kyrgyzstan as well.

We decide to spend what is left of the afternoon. We stay close to the lake that is nicely cool, but has few mosquito bites included - free of charge. After dinner (watermelon) we once again build our Palace in the bushes and notice that we are all burnt - the morning Sun was too hot for our skin. No matter that, we set off to camp.
