We are proudly presenting our new sponsor, company [Sledenje](http://www.sledenje.com "Sledenje.com"). They are slovenian biggest GPS tracking provider and they will instal their device into our vehicle, that would allow us to beep our accourate signal of our location directly on your screen. They are working for Geopedija, Najdi.si zemljevidi, even cooperate with Google Maps and they offered us [Sledenje Premium package](http://www.sledenje.com/storitve_paketi_premium.php "Sledenje - paket Premium"), that allows GPS tracker to communicate with a GPS device (Garmin) and allows immediate position on the screen inside the car, with latest maps.

That is how we will receive access to all maps, all territories avaliable. For a backup plan, Russian military maps are on the way as well.

They are working on another sponsorship, so for now we can only be 100% honest and tell you how satisfied we are with them, because they were up for it in the moment and also already posses experience with simmilar expeditions from the past. Another great source of information.

Thank you, [Sledenje](http://www.sledenje.com "Sledenje.com").
