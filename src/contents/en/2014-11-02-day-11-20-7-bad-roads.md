We open our doors and breathe in first real Kazakhstan air in the morning. Temperatures are still refreshing and early spring alike. We transform our bedroom back into cockpit and living room and find owned of the place. We thank him for having us and he refused to get paid, he just wished us pleasant journey.

Well, that was a surpris - we wonder what will follow. Landscape changed entirely, you can still find some typical birches along roads but they are rare now. We have small bushes and grases all around us. And one more thing - everything is flat. We only saw one or two hills. It's that very same feeling seeing into an endless sea. There is a bus station every while for villagers, but they have to live at least three kilometers away. We find some villages with simple houses, with ducks, goats, sheep and a cow in front of them.

We are going towards Astana, Kazakhstan capital. We are almost alone, probably because it is sunday. We would like to see pristine countryside so we pick the road that is not the best. We heard before that roads in Kazakhstan are bad, but we are sure that it can't be so bad. We had never been so wrong in our lives. After awhile, things are not funny anymore, we are shaking and driving 20 km/h and less. Katja take some serious dumps and holes and we are without words, only headache is going worse and worse. It's heartstopping.

I have no idea how this is even possible. Even new roads they make are shitty to be fair. They don't even fix holes, aaaargh. Sometimes we drive on meadows since that is better road that normal pavement. Locals are doing the same, but they are overtaking us with 80km/h at least as if there is no holes at all. Epilogue follows, we fight with Matej and i start to cry. I'm not doing this anymore.

Well, that is not technically true - I continue to drive, but slowly taking one bump after another hoping for some divinity to come to help us. X-ray vision would be great to have.

We drove from Kostanay to Kokshketau, made 160 kilometers in 7 hours. We are desperately looking for market. We find it and low prices turns smile to our faces. We eat icecream for 50 cents, markets looks like ours 20 years before, where there was no choice, but we had bubble gums om cigarette shapes and mini chocolates for couple of cents.

From here on, Matej takes steering wheel and ha-ha, all holes magically disappears. We hit only highway in the country, four lanes. Can you imagine my face after driving that many hours and than Matej takes same distance in only 2?

Just before Astana we ran out of diesel and we have reserve on when we turn into a gas station. They don't have diesel. C'mon man, it's over nine o'clock and there is 60 kilometers to next station. We drive though we didn't believe we will manage to reach it and we do eventually (Driving 80km/h for saving). They have similar news for us, no diesel. We figure out that our Ford posseses 65l reservoir when we finally drive into Astana at 01:30. We sleep at a truck stop once again after Matej improvises with duct-tape. We have some rain and need small roof to be able to keep our windows open through the night.

 

And yes, we know - we talk and talk about that bad conditioned roads, holes everywhere. And here is some footage for you to even believe us. Avoid road Kostanai - Kokshketau road if you can.

Note that we missed Boroevoe district with natural lake and hill near Kokshketau. Take a look if you can, it is simply magnificent, a local treasure and we are sorry we missed it.
