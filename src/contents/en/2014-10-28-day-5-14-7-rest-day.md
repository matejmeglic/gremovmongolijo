We are sleeping until noon. Yes, it was a remarkable run in the last couple of days. It was vast, fast and sometimes even dangerous. And lifelong decision; we will not drive half awake anymore, it's too risky.

We are kindly greeted by Elya (Elina Amelchenkova), the kindest among all russian girls and also Matej's very good friend. She starts speaking furiously in russian and Katja soon figures out that it won't work until she learn some russian. We check our plan, we show our car and the walk to Moscow downtown. We see Bolshoi theatre, Red square and Matej finds out he forgot to change batteries for his GoPro Hero3+ Silver. We go to biggest and most famous store GUM and get ourselves icecream there and then walk around Kremlin.

Oh, did we mention that it is 30 degrees outside, it's crazy hot and we are in long pants because it's written in Lonely planet that you cannot enter Kremlin with shorts (it's not true, they let us inside even with our bag, they only asked if we have any bombs with us). Well, we didn't make it any further, in was open only until 18:00 - ah, Russians.

We are looking at soldiers changing watch infront of Kremlin gates and then we go to Arbat district. Yes, it's like haymarket. We sit into a nice Japanese restaurant and wait for 15minutest, then we order noodles. It took them almost half an hour and we were not satisfied. They looked horrible and didn't taste much better. Matej forgot that you need to look at portion size in grams in Russia, so we were still hungry.

Sad we pack out things and move along. We are watching sunset at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. That is one of those 9 tall structures that were built by Stalin for his government needs.

Oh, fun fact - sunset is here at 22:30, FYI. And it is still light even one hour after. We visit a supermarket for cheese rolls. We cook at home and have another dinner. Katja said I cooked well - microwave power all the way.
