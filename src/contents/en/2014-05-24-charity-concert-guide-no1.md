When a person decides, that he will have a charity concert and did not do that before, he can not think on all facts necessary for successful realization. And since I don't organize thing professionaly, there were quite some surprises along the way and if you ever step into these waters, I hope that this article will make it a little bit easier for you.

Because it is a Charity concert, you probably have 0 budget. And because of that, we appreciate all musicians, that will come and play for free. I know by now, that all Thank you words said tomorrow will not be big enough for their big hearts, because even that they work far away (half of performers is from Logatec that is 70 kilometers away), that does not represent any obstacle at all. To our luck, we are surrounded by people, that are always willing to help. This time it was no difference.

Where to set a concert was no question. Adergas Church is so spacious and acoustic and has hosted such events before, so it was choice number one. Priest Slavko Kalan took care about parking spaces, sound system and number of seats. For every one of listeners we will find space to seat and enjoy in divine music.

Then it was the promotion, so we had transformed into postmen and use sunny days and deliver over 2000 flyers/personal invitations to nearby villages and settlements. We also occupied local information tables with over 50 posters. We had four interviews and 6 radio stations delivered word about our concert. We have to put a special shoutout to mayor of Cerklje na Gorenjskem, mister Franc ÄŒebulj, who delivered special over-road sign that informed public about our event.

Local Culture spots (KUD Visoko and KUD Predoslje) sent e-invitations to their mailing lists. We created facebook event and invite over 2500 people. You have to love to work in such creative environment.

You have to think about CGP (corporate identity of the project) that was designed by Matej to differ from other events that are currently based in the area. It has to be clear, easy to spot and read, and you have to think and deliver all documents in the same format in order for people to remember certain brand. We specially wanted to set our logo to a easy-spot place. You also can not forget to include all sponsors into your replies.

There is also reporting of the event to a local police station, SAZAS, snacks for performers (since they will be here major part of the day for free), preparation of the concert halls, and bunch of other small things that needs to be arranged.

We did everything to deliver a quality event, and are now holding fingers crossed that you all visitors will fill the church to the very end and that at the end we will all be satisfied. We, to raise lots of money, performers to perform in front of the crowd and you to participate in this evening and to make our project come true. In our second reply we will write about other stuff needed and decisions taken.
