As mentioned in previous post, we visited Offroad Mamut 4x4, company whose owner are not just the biggest experts in offroad area and converting vehicles. They made simmilar route in 2010, so they were full of information.

I found them 2 months ago, but it seems like a lifetime, flow of life is so intense right now. Igor and Blanka (that are an amazing couple, so kind and relaxed. Not to mention their kids) were so helpful and decided to give away few things that they sell in their show. We got tyre pressure regulator and spare set of lights. When we will set them up, Russia will be light up.

IgorÂ and Blanka, thank you again and we wish you all the best in Australia.

Right after that we received a call from alpine climber Luka Plut, that already was in Kirgyzstan and is in the middle of preparation for next alpine mission in India. He lent us Lonely planet and give away a showel and few other pieces of gear.
