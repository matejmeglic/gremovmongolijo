What is the first thing you do, when you wake up. You take another shower, because it will be the last one for couple of days. And then - breakfast. It seems like we are the only guests and staff is still sleepy. We get pre-made sandwitches and cold eggs. It's good we have a bakery right next to hotel.

We look at our map while we are travelling south. Matej in fairly good pace drive through Ulaan-Baatar and here comes Katja's turn to take over. Few 10 kilometers of gravel and we find tarmac. And what a tarmac, in two hours we reach Mandalgovi, where we stop for refuel and to visit a local store. Don't buy icecream, they are all too old to be consumed. We are not taking any chances.

Good road is going on and on and on, we are driving 130 km/h. Desert is barren, empty and vast, small grass, herbs and a bush now and then. What a great conditions for blending the road block in this picture. Katja notices it a moment too late and we are offroad, flying sideways. Luckily, we are fine - all three of us. We should be more carefull though, please note that road block without signs is something normal in Mongolia. It is to show you that there is construction going on on the next sector of the road. There are few scratches on the car and we are shocked, but we pulled a good move, and were very lucky. Next two hours we progress very slowly and are pulling over every 10 kilometers to check tires. At the end of the day, we are checking tires with our eyes closed.

After this undesired event, we drive carefully and we are less talkative. Road is not that good anymore, lots of unmarked sections and road blocks that surprise us one after another. We drive a off-road section through Gobi, changing our terrain every minute. Sand and swamp, exchanging, both convenient for for getting stuck.

Marking your spots is essential if you would like to drive back the same way.\[/caption\]

We drive even when the night falls, and we reach Dalandzagad - last city and a bastion of civilization, right before reaching in the most sandy part of the Gobi desert. We park the car in first street, eat one tuna can each and watch a movie. We sleep near a factory, waiting for the next day.
