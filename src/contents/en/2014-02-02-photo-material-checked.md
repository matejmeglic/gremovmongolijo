Great news again. We have received sponsorship in photo-studio [Foto Čebron](http://foto.si/ "Foto Čebron"). They will take care for everything from photo-material, that we will send out to you after expedition. It is our way of saying Thank you for participation in our mission. They will provide high-resolution prints for our photo-exhibitions as well.

We had worked with [Foto Čebron](http://foto.si "Foto Čebron")  on our other projects in the past and can only recommend them. They are extremely reliable partner with great knowledge, advising competence and top-of-the-line equipment. We have to mention that they work almost 24/7 and are always ready to serve you as you, as client, deserve. Check their websites, they have an e-program as well; you can easily send your pictures in and receive them next day via regular mail. Perfect.
