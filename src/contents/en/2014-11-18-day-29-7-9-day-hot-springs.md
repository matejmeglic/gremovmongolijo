After morning coffee, bedroom transforms back into car and we enter the city of Bayankhongor. Cities are different here; they are having basic ingreedients of a city like school, bank, shop and post office, and are surrounded with small houses and gers, parceled properties. Because it rains, we hit hotel for lunch. It's not a 5-star hotel, but they have French Fried (fries) and orange juice.

We found out that there are hot springs in the area. They are probably not like hot springs in Slovenia, but we wouldn't mind shower, or water at all. After long search, turning around and driving same road over and over, we give in - we won't find it. We set the cours for Arvaikheer, next city on the Souther route towards UB. Road paved, but we drive on the side many times, because it's full of holes. Looks like no-one maintains the road after they are built and winters here are tough, even to -50 degrees Celsius.

Little before the city we find a great fenced area and some sort of temple inside. There are statues of horses on the side and one more in the atrium, the mightiest statue of horse and Buddha behind it. We pay 500 chinggis for tickets and enter this manmade sculpture - first after we came into Mongolia. Fence is covered with blue scarfs, and Buddha is surrounded with vodka, cookies, money, juice, pictures... you name it. It's meant as a tribute to horses, winners of Nadaam race in the area, and grass is covered with mice - pikas. There are many horse skulls laying around the temple and we discover this is a burial place for hores chapmions (only multiple winner is burried here with full body attached, heads are more common).

Gravel road is leading us into the sunset, to Taragt city. It's a small city, but has paved road, aproximatelly 200 metres in lenght. And because there is no sign of our hot springs once again, we park for dinner behind a hill. There are herbs all over the place, replacing grass. Every move smells with such a great aroma.

P.s.: Mongolian road are in such bad conditions, that you need a daily dose of your mechanic skills. You have to tighten up/replace every screw in the car. And car provides not-healthy black cloud from exhaust system in the morning.
