It's 8:30 when we wake up on the parking spot along the gas station. Because Matej was tired yesterday we found a spot where you can stay overnight for 100 RUB (that's roughly 2 EUR), relatively safe and under supervision. We were surprised to see how many vehicles was there. They have toilets as well but Katja didn't used them as they were too dirty even for our standards. Not to mention hordes of hungy mosquitoes waiting for us outside.

Our today's goal is city of Perm, around 1000 kilometers away from where we are. First station is as usual nearest gas station. We wash the car, because we barely see through the windows and we restore lights to full working conditions. Smell of roasted mosquitoes is just disgusting - remember how fish smell and that it the reason they smell like that. Then it's our turn for refreshments, first washing our teeth and breakfast right after that. We are eating croissants - we are saving all unused calories for Mongolia.

We hit the road and Matej is a bit loud about monotonous driving but before he finishes the sentence, we start pulling off to the side of the road. There is a blue Opel Corsa also stopping ahead of us, and a man walks out of the car. Matej disappears and Katja becomes worried about the subject. We were pulled over because of Matej's mad driving skills and this man, Mr. Mikhailov pulled us over just to congratulate us. We receive vodka and Uha - fish soup, freshly made. It looked awful and we accepted it because we were being polite. We threw it away as soon as we left the place, and sir informed us that he is retired police officer and that we are safe in this or next district - just call him. Such a funny character, totally made our day.

After that, Matej was on fire and he made 800 kilometers in a row, stopping only for refill. And seriously, short after event with Mr. Mikhailov we were pulled over, but it was just a routine check. We talked abit about the project and were released soon after. We even got chief officer to shake our hands. Our path turns up north again. Because of the rain we covered the car with mud and had to clean car windows quite frequently. Villages around the road are becoming typical Russian settlements, with beautiful surroundings. Landscapes are changing, from taiga to swamps, green grass fields and back. Here we could produce food for half of the world, but no-one seems to care about that here. On the other hand, we are focused on the road, some bad cracks and holes out there.

It's funny because all along the way we are accompanied with road signs declarind distance from Moscow - every kilometer is one. They have sales right on the road, selling raspberies, blueberries, apples and milk. And clothes and some stuff, it's like a hay-market on the street. We don't stop since we don't trust their food and times fly by much faster than expected.

We are four hours ahead of Slovenia (we skipped from UTC+3 to UTC+5 today) and evenings are bright even at 00:15, when we turn into center of Perm city. We are not fascinated, it's one more industrial russian city, but we get our night shopping at 24/7 supermarket.  We decide to leave town as soon as possible since we gather some strange looks from people driving by, even following us.

We hit freeway once more and are quite happy but - after only 4 kilometers road stops and we are on gravel!!!! C'mon Russia, you can do it better. We are tired and soon we reach for gas station, where we spent the night, guarded by domesticated dog.
