Just few minutes ago, we received a letter from one of most important businessmen , mister [Ivo Boscarol](http://www.pipistrel.si/ "Pipistrel") Â personally, CEO of Pipistrel, a company that produces ultra-light airplanes. What is more important, he wrote from Ulaan-Baatar, and his first words were "Mind the roads, they really are terrible." He invited us to have lunch with him, if the time shows we will be in Ulaan on the same dates.

Thank you mister Boscarol - invitation (challenge) accepted.
