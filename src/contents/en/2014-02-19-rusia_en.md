Matej has been learning russian language in agency [Linguarus](http://linguarus.si/ "Linguarus") for last three years. He'd done presentation of the project a while ago in his class. Linguarus was thrilled about the project and wanted to participate as partner, their generous help is much appreciated. We hope that communication in russian language on the road won't represent any major problems.

They brought their latest work, a hit-pocket book for private and business users, a dictionary called **[Sprašujemo in odgovarjamo po rusko, po slovensko](http://linguarus.si/e_trgovina/knjige/48/sprasujemo_in_odgovarjamo_po_rusko_po_slovensko/) - Questions and answers in russian, in slovene.** This dictionary is really useful, it consists of ordinary phrases, useful for normal life; and searching is really simple. We're recommending you to take a closer look and give it a shoot. It's never to late to start.[![](images/48-sprasujemo_in_odgovarjamo_po_rusko_po_slovensko_velika-6f12fa13805db6ce.jpg)](http://linguarus.si/e_trgovina/knjige/48/sprasujemo_in_odgovarjamo_po_rusko_po_slovensko/)
