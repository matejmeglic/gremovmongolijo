New week, new sponsorship. From GO-HELP they informed us that company GlobalVision donated VIP licence for use of application ViewRanger. Application is running on every major mobile platform and consists of extremely accurate maps and embedded trekking routes. We're already testing it and can tell you that even Slovenia is approved.

More to come this week, stay tuned.
