At last, everything came together. We have all requirements for legal entity and bank account, so currently you can already see our fancy new first page with details and simplified navigation.

The most essential part is that now you can donate from everywhere, straight-forward to account SI56 0700 0000 2094 223 and don't forget to send us [e-mail](mailto:gremovmongolijo@gmail.com "MAIL") right after, so we can check, if everything went well.

More stuff coming soon, still lots of things to do this week, and we would really like to sleep more than 4 hours per night. Maybe for the weekend. :) Next assignment? Raising funds and buying vehicle... at last.

Stay tuned for more stories from FENNECteam Mongolia.
