We race entire city in a cab, driving in suspicious areas and board the airplane. We then survive 9 hours flying across all Central Asia. Right before the takeoff Matej receive a special check because of the sand we are trying to smuggle across. We neggotiate one small bottle, but put all 2,5 litres of sand back in when they are too busy to watch. We fly to Istanbul (small stop in Kyrgyzstan) and find a metro that takes us to the city and then find a cheap hotel right next to Hagia Sofia stop, where we bargain the price. Evening walk around Topkapi and Hagia Sofia and kebab. Great feeling we made it back to Europe.

There are no photos taken and so, no photos are attached to this post.
