We were in Ulaan before, simply because you can not avoid the city once you are in the region and you want to go into different part of the country. Or you simply want to drive the best roads they have. And we are going there for the last time, in a while at least. We are driving and soon we realize how much we adopted to their driving styles. Honking all the way is really useful combination for overtaking.

Lots of cars is imported from Japan and has steering wheel at the left side, which is cheaper version, but less safe one as well. And number of passengers in the car is one whole another story, you have to have at least 7 people in the car in order to drive somewhere. No matter what, we find a place where we clean our Ford, before we deliver it. And this is as well the last place for our signal, because we turn it off.

Ulaan Baatar accepts us late afternoon, where we find accomodation and spend the night at comfortable bed.
