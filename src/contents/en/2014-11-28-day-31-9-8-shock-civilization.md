Right before we set our course for Ulaan-Bataar, we decide to take a quick stop and step into Erdene ZuuKhiid. We have to wait for Mongols to wake up, so we afford our breakfast on the nearby meadow. From the distance, we can see a big heard of sheep and goats approaching - and pass right next to us not even bothering we are here. When the clock shows us 10:00, gates open for visitors. First mongol temple is quite crowded, people are walking around walls as well, locals and we finally see some foreigners as well. Place has already had it's own 'Best years', but you can feel the spirit and how majestic once was.

One of the temples is Tibet-alike, and second one is related to Buddha in all times of his life. In the middle, you can see remaining of giant ger once stood there to hail great architect Zanabazar and his birthday he once celebrated here. Zanabazar created most of notable and remaining structures in Mongolia. We did not find turtle rock, that stands as guardian for the city and in mongol mythology stands for eternity.

Ulaan-Bataar is waiting for us. After good four hours of slow drive and a stop for lunch along the road we reach our destination. We are really early for our schedule, but Fried Tomato team came just in time. And because tarmac gets better, we of course need to pay the toll. A view on this huge city is just out of ... literally anything we expected. After spending last few weeks in our little lonely farytale, we weren't quite sure what to expect, but the city is vast. Looks like everybody is living here. Few industrial chimneys reaching towards the sky, lots of skyscraper (most of them still under construction) and lots of gers or small houses that are spreaded across nearby hills. It like in the anthill. Since we were alone on the road for last two weeks or so, it's hard to start to follow the rules once more and driving in rushhour is quite a shock. Trying to break through, we spot a familiar logo, Mongol Rally and we are turning our engines around. Mongol Rally is similar to Mongolia Charity Rally, but they are not giving their vechiles at the end - they have engine limited to maximum size of 1.200 ccm. That means that you are about to drive in Ford Fiesta, if you take Mongol rally. We visit their Finish line which turns out to be car graveyard, we speak to organizators and to some ralliers who just arrived.

While we are searching for appropriate accomodation we get lost a few times and are watching this impressive city. Huge differences between different streets; one shiny and magnificent and next one from gangster movies. And you can change tires everyone, on every corner. We find our hotel - what else would you desire. Thank you Hugo and Yomina.
