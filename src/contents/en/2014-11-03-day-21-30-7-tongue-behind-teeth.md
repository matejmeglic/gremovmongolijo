Last days of internet are slowly coming, Mongolia is closer every day. Medical problems are not bothering us anymore, yesterdays healing sleep helped us to push into our last thousand kilometers in Kazakhstan for a while. Katja tries luck with the road and gives up after three hours, because she is told she drives too slow and that we would need to extend our trip with that tempo. Well, let the loud copilot try these roads. And in the matter of facts, he does that.

He takes the wheel (off-road position of the hands), puts the foot on the throttle and starts to fly across the holes. Hole after hole, slowly we master it. Stress-level has increased in these couple of days, so we almost receive few heart attacks hitting some of the bumps. And because we were up to some new relationships we drove a few kilometers too fast, we hit radar once more and our wish came true. We appreciate policeman for taking his time, we are 10.000 TNG lighter - try to bargain more, I was weak at that point.

While driving, your tongue is safely held behind your teeth. We know that sometimes you have to support all this whining about roads, so we stop ant take some photos. And meanwhile we walk along the road like C.S.I. forensics and are being honked constantly by other inhabitants, a red Mitsubishi L200 stopps. He is codenamed Fried Tomato and we found Dutch licence plates. "Ho, we are going to meet some turist at last." comments Matej. And then the sentence "We are Hugo and Yamina and we are doing the same trip as you do. We are taking this one to Mongolia, but we are travelling without stickers, because they were sending them late." Our eyeball almost fell out of their holes. Few minutes before Matej was bragging about how we are 100% sure that we are first rally participants driving this road and that there will never be a team that would choose this road. Ha-ha, we cannot believe it. C'mon, what are the odds to meet a fellow co-rally team in the middle of Kazakh steppe, unannounced?!

We have a short chat and we are back on the road, because we are late and night is falling. We decide that we would drive together to Mongolia, and then took our own way (they are thinking about northern route as they don't have so much time). Matej is extremely happy about that occurrence and names our group of two a convoy. We talk only when we stop for toilet and we are curious about each other. Mens part of the combined team is exchanging in lead, showing off. We drive through quite difficult tarmac. And because the light is long gone, we drive to Oskemen and stay there for the night. This time we pushed our luck with diesel second time, we drove 536 kilometers without stopping.

Diesel is really cheap. Matej fills reservoir so full that he accidentally spoils some on the flor around the car. Ups, it better be full.

PS: Matej uses his Russian negotiation skills to achieve lower prices for all four of us. We drove 1062 kilometers today.
