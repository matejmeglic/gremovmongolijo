**Donation of the vehicle to a local community can in our opinion really provides huge impact towards better life. Local doctor gets big range and improves time efficiency, and at once he can deliver more good from first bigger settlement as it was possible before that. Same goes with mail, not to mention that once or twice a week he can take children from the village to school. With appropriate organization life before and after donation of the vehicle cannot really be compared.**

### How can I support the project?

### 1. Regular way - do it manually

Of course we are most happy, if we can collect donations in person, there is no need for paying a transaction fee and we can hear, what do you think about the project. Grab our hand, don't be shy - and no worries, everything will be 100% transparent, and the money will be on bank account in no time. We aslo provided legal permit for collecting donations.

### 2. Transfer to a bank account

For everyone who decides to support this project, you can transfer donation straight to our bank account. We have registered a association called Humanitarno društvo Gremo v Mongolijo, you can find correctly filled [SEPA payment form](http://gremovmongolijo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/08042014_SEPA_case.jpg) at first page of the [Gremo v Mongolijo](http://gremovmongolijo.com) portal.

### 3\. PayPal

**IMPORTANT:** We would like to ask you to participate in other ways of donations, PayPal payments use as a last way out, because currently they are charging 8%+0,30 EUR per transction and that is significantly over the sum we were expecting. We are working on that.

### 4\. Justgiving direct transfer to GO-HELP

We have collected few opinions with different thinking. If you are one of them and clearly do not trust in our team and capabilities of charity behaviour, we had set you a way our. Here comes the challenge: Every team has to participate a sum of 1000 GBP in order to even start this expedition, so we set up [JustGiving page for FENNECteam Mongolia 2014](https://www.justgiving.com/FENNECteam-Mongolia-2014) just for you. On this site you can donate funds directly to GO-HELP organization from your credit/debet card.
