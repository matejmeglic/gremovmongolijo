As usual we should start with... We woke up into a... but, we didn't. We are awake since yesterday and we are already feeling it, this one will be a long one. We park the car in the shade and wash our teeth on the street and then go straight into Gorky park, slowly and sleepy eating breakfast.

We stop by for coffee and toiled, Matej has some diarrhea problems, but no big deals. Almaty is ex-capital city where Iskratel has subsidiary Iskracom. And we pay them a visit. Matej is occupied with various problems, Katja finds some time to update blog and facebook, they give her her own office - conference room. They are also very happy that we had no problems whatsoever. At 16:00 we take some promotional shots with the car and then they surprise us with cake and watermellon.

Igor takes us to a viewpoint, where you can see whole Almaty. They have it all, from ski jumping complex, to 2-kilometer ski slope, swimming pool, opera, everything your heart desire. We discuss about life in Kazakhstan over a glass of lemonade. He says that Almay looks like big Kranj and that he likes it very much since there is great development felt in the city.

Afternoon quickly turns into evening, 35 degrees into bearable 25. Here days are much shorter than in the north, and sunset is moved for one hour ahead. Unbelievable difference since we traveled only 2000 kilometers measured north-south. We close our day in a local pub where beer is almost free, and atmosphere is very nice. We thank Igor once more for everything, that he did for us and for all the time, spent for two random travelers. We fell into our bed - we had been up for more than 40 hours.
