We register in the morning. Yes, every foreigner has to register in Kazakhstan, if you are staying for more than 5 days. Then we have huge breakfast and we hit the road, Kazakh steppe ahead of us, a royal piece of road, some sort of Tour de France for every biker.

We have a wild plan to hit 1280 kilometers from Astana to Almaty in one piece. And there we have it, road block after road block, queue after queue. Matej is turning his eyes around when we have exits to the fields. We are back where we were two days ago. On very bad gravel. Well, it takes us couple of hours to reach Karaganda, where we have first big scene. This steppe, desert or whatever you call it is huge. That means that you can see for 20 kilometers in advance and there is nothing, only grass surrounding you everywhere. We record some promotional videos and it takes us an hour. Again.

And then Matej starts to drive, suicidal. He bought a traditional Kazakhstanian hat and now he thinks he is one of then. He is driving 120-130 acorss all bumps and he is doing really good. We are still the slowest on the road and we are wondering why everyone is so rushing. You can get used to hit bumps. We make several stops when sun starts to set. Kazakh steppe gets us some incredible scenes.

Matej is fascinated and is jumping around everytime when after one small hill view opens in another 20-kilometer stage of hills and roads. We meet policeman every now and then, but we have luck on our side. Night comes to soon and we only stop for refill on well lit gas stations.

We experience price drop to incredible 0,46 EUR, but so is the quality. We have old version of TDI motor, and have no problems so far. We pay in cash only, since they don't have any machines and we tank every 300 kilometers, because you get out of gas stations every while.  Little after 23:00 Katja takes over and all of a sudden, road turns into one big hole. Typical. It wasn't Katja's fault, this stage was really one of the worst roads in the country. Matej sleeps for a hour and a half and then we switch again. At 4:44 we see Almaty for the first time, lit by first morning rays. But it is really just the first look, we still have 70 kilometers to the city. There will be no sleep tonight, we arrive in the city at 06:12, tired and exhausted. We can feel a hot day coming, yesterday was 37 degrees. We go to park to have breakfast - we made it.
