Last week we comunicated live for the first time. Volunteers from organization GO-HELP were really nice, though we experienced some technical difficulties at the beginning; there was a lot of stress involved. Afterwards they provided us with TOLL-FREE number, which we found extraordinary for Slovenia. Thanks guys.

We were talking for aprox. 45 minutes about visas and how to get them, and a little bit about vehicles at the end of conversation, about restrictions from mongol government, about appropriate age and models. It was a group conversation, so we heard voices of other teams for the first time as well.

What we need (visas): - Azerbaijan visa - Kazakhstan visa - Russian visa - Mongol visa

and optional: - Uzbekistan visa - Tajikistan visa

For Kyrgizistan and Georgia we as EU citizens are not requested to posess visa for short-term stay. How cool is that? Does anyone has any information about how to get them, in which order etc.?

Anyhow, we had already provided new team personal photos and started procedure of issuing new passports.
