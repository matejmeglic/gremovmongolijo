Today we took our first dose of shots. We strongly recommend you to take that point earlier that we did, because it will be tight and in case of side effects, we could go off schedule right at the beginning.

Essential shots: - Tetanus (it's free and is covered by basic medical ensurance in Slovenia, 1 shot every 10 years) - Hepatitis A (two shots; right away and after a year) - Hepatitis B (after year 1991 you were already cured for this and you don't need that. Contains three shots: right away, after 28 days and after one year) -Â Tick meningoencefalitis (two shots: right away and in a fourtnight)

Katja is now immune to HepA and Tick bytes, Matej decided to take full list. We need to come back on 7th July for one more series. Thank you for treating us so nicely.
