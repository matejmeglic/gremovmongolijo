Our car codenamed Zhvau (meaning animalic) was shining in afternoon sun and was getting ready for show-off that was about to come. 4-hour waxing and cleaning was so worth it. Soon our noble guests arrived and when you walked into the church during rehersals, you could already feel positive enegry that was floating all around us. And the evening was even bigger: more than 200 guests were listening to 106 performers on stage, beautifully connected for one cause. 300 hundred hearts, beating together. Thank you for standing ovations at the end of the show, and thank you, our beloved musicians. Your will really doesn't know no limits.

If we draw the line, we raised 1105,15 EUR just in this evening. That is one wicked sum and we are so proud on it.

THANK YOU again, everyone who participated.
