Seems like sleeping in a car is not so bad at all, because we wake up quite late. We brush our teeth on the nearest gas station and decide that we will have breakfast in Brest, Belarus. We only have good 50 kilometers and a border crossing. We are never been so wrong in our lives. :) GPS takes us through the outskirts of Poland.

The line at border crossing Ternopol doesn't seem so long. We stop our car at 10:10, get ready our passports and car documentation and start to play some Rummy, for time to pass by quicker. At the border everyone is slow and all procedures are taking unusually long. Policemen are moving from one vehicle to the other and then disappear in their cottages, as if they would have a coffee every ten minutes.

We still manage to get a green light and we cross Poland's part of the boarding - and fall into next, longer line. This doesn't look promising at all, people are walking around the car freely, talking to each other even if they see them for the first time. And they are very interested in our car, full of stickers. Second meeting with an officer is strange - he looks weirdly at the car and then stares even more when we open the trunk. He comments something like "that is alot of baggage" and lets us through. Then across the bridge and into the green line for Belarus - nothing to declare.

We are waiting and waiting for the control check but then again, we are informed that Green line is for locals only and that we need to get back in line. We breathe in and out and go all the way back for Red line - Something to declare. Here, the line is not moving at all, everything last ten times longer. Waiting, reconfiguration of vehicles, singing out some form in multiple editions, in russian of course. Its 14:00 and at 16:30 we have all documentation settled, it's time to meet customs officer. We are so happy that we will finally set off that we open our trunk with no worries whatsoever. Wrong. It is the law that you can take 50kg per person across the border when entering Belarus and every kilogram over that limit is 4 EUR of customs no matter what it is. She is staring at our trunk asking if there are only two persons in the car. We say yes and in the next second, we are obligated to take everything out of the car to weight it. We are aprox. 190 kilograms over the top limit, most of it due to some charity clothing one partner provided. We couldn't even bargain for food, but we managed to let all our gas, water and spare wheel through. Eventually we turned back around and went to Poland - we could not afford to pay 400 EUR. Then we are informed that there is a container that saves things. We went there and drop all charity stuff we had for Mongolia and went back in line. And yes, we found this guy Alexey who took some of our baggage to his car in exchange for 20 EUR and went across the border with his family. It's a common business there, but next time we would probably go through Ukraine. Ant then, the line procedure repeats.

_(we're gathering signatures of everybody that helps along the way)_

Queue was even longer than the last time, and we got some mosquitos for the night. We test our nets at rear windows and sleep tight, moving vehicle every now and then. We waited 9 hours this time and Matej drove into Belarus at 5:50. We managed to drive 53 kilometers and eat abit of dried rice and indian nuts.
