How to glue stickers?

Useful hints: car has to be cooled down and parked in the shade. Beside that, use loads of water, to moisture the spot that you plan to put sticker to. That will allow you some minor corrections even, when you will place sticker and air ballons can be led out or you can pin it later with pin.
