Istanbul surprises us. It is quite sleepy in the morning. And there are all these salesman that are desperate to sell you something, anything. Colours and spirits, all beauty the city has to offer. We are impressed with architecture, and we are busy shopping. Katja is desperately searching for clothes and then the day ends with Matej's shopping spree. We do a morning prayer in Hagia Sofia, then we follow the bazaar and Topkapi, we cross The Galata bridge and run over Istikal street. Taksim is next and then we have a fine dinner at sunset and then watch colourful fountains in fron of Sultanahmat. We will return to Istanbul, for all of you who would like to walk the same way, we prepared a Google map.

There is not much left to say, we ate a lot, spend some money and there was not a thing to worry about. At last.
