Our plan was to leave Almaty behind us as soon as possible and travel as far north as we can, towards Russia and then Mongolia. BUT, we were contacted by another Slovene, Maks Selan, professional hockey player that recently signed for Kazakhstan league for a year. And because in these few thousand kilometers that are currently separating us from using č, š, ž and other special characters on a daily basis, we of course agree to meet with our practically neighbor from Bohinj. We meet at MEGA - the biggest shopping center right after his first training that day.

Big mistake, Katja surrounded by shops becomes aaggressive shopping mode turned on. ;) Back to our meeting. We are talking for three hours over water and tea. We just can't stop talking about all adventures from the road and we tell him about all Slovene living in Almaty that we know. This is likely to become Slovenian oasis here in Asia. Maks succeeds to put us without words when he talks about his living here and his career, he has so tight schedules and almost no time to rest. You have to train even if you get sick. Late in the afternoon we decide to leave Almaty and want to drive as far as we can. That didn't quite worked the way we planned due to new diarrhea, quite few stops ended in bushes along the road.

From today on, we have specially selected company. Old bread, chocolate and carbon pills. When sun sets down and Katja after 6 hours of driving manages 300 kilometers we find nearest motel and schedule our use of the toilet. There is a window near the bed and right after that window owner are watching TV late in the night. We are not bothered by that, we sleep tight today.
