Neža Verdinek has published new [blog post on Verjamem v sonce](http://nezav.blogspot.com/2014/05/koncert-dobrih-src.html "Verjamem v sonce") (I believe in Sun) blog about us and our project and about charity concert. I know Neža for a while, she sings in MePZ Adoramus Logatec and we performed together couple of times. Thank you Neža, for your support and for spreading good words.

Last week, I was at Russian embassy, I talked about the project and some random guy approached to me and told me he was from Zreče (That is actually quite far away) and that he already heard about us and Gremo v Mongolijo project. How cool is that?
