We leave for Altay from our humble camp near the stream. This time, not the Altay The Mountain Range, but Altay, main city in the district. We are greeted by eagles and killed few insects with idea of travelling with us.

We went across all valley and found some tarmac again. Yes, tarmac - this Mongolia is really something. They make you brand new road in the desert, but they forget about the signs - that means there are no speed limits and no signs pointing aproximate way or destination you're driving to. We drive up to 120km/h. We stop after one hour and find a small forrest, a nesting ground for at least 15 eagles. We continue along and around 40 kilometers before Darvi city, tarmac is gone, we take the gravel as well. We refill our tanks in the city, basically everytime we see a gas station. That is advice from Aleš and Igor, slovenian offroaders we visited. What a smart choice, we march ahead ... into Gobi desert.

Yes, desert itself changes its view every few kilometers, from steepe to bushes, plain rock or gravel. And with every terrain, we modify our driving style, drifting many times and then, only ten minutes away we are getting stuck in the sand due to too high tyre pressure.

The Dutch are not far behind so we decide to have a quick stop for lunch at a mountain passage, while only 300 meters away, wild camels graze. We circle the Ovoo and drive into next valley that provide one of the best stages we've driven. Crazy downhill ride that we hope we caught on camera in full lenght.Speed between 40 and 60 km/h and every terrain you can imagine changing faster and faster. Katja gets sick so we slow down as we reach Jargalantin city and ask for direction. Map is coming to an end, and we start driving south, not east anymore. We stop at local Stupa, temple and check sunset there. We drive back into the mountains and soon, we are hot-wiring the car - luckily, it wasn't ours. Mission accomplished, Buddha would be proud.

Katja's health is getting worse by every minute and we decide we cannot reach Altay today, we will camp in the mountains 50 kilometers ahead. We could take paved road in the morning, but we decided for a more scenic route. Do not forget to throw some stones underneath the tires when parking uphill as we did. Luckily, without consequences.
