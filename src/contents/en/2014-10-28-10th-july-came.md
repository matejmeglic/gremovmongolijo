And the time came, when counter on the website stopped counting :) It's The Day and with all power we are getting ready for the way. Impatience and travel-fever will be behind at last and all energy will transform into focus on the eternal road ahead

 

We are packing last pieces of equipment together on this rainy Thursday and are calculating the space to benefit most of it. I'm trying to smuggle any additional T-shirts into my backpack, but there is Matej that collects all stuff and puts it back into closets, one after another.

You still have time to rearrange your afternoon plans and come at Jože Pučnik airport to meet and greet us, travelers of the world. Parking space will not be a problem, we got you covered.

We hope that our Ford Ranger (codenamed Žvau - Beast) will serve us well.
