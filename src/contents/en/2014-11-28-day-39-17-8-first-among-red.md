Ulaan Baatar  or The Red Hero inspires. Glitch and greyness at one streets. There is no typical poverty seen, but there is ger settlement only 100 meters from beautiful parlaiment and 40-storeys 5-star hotel. We pay a visit in bakery and then take a look around the main square.

They found the highest number of dinosaur remainings in the World, but their Dinosaurs Museum is closet due to bad conditions of the building and too poor safety. OK, we will take a look at National Mongolian Museum which is really good. We are grasping for mongol history and are then told that first museum still exists, just a couple blocks away. We march to the east again.

Well, we find the street, and then the building and then, the entrance. They would like to have an entrance fee that costs 1,2 EUR. We pay and are then taken in a small hall with four dinosaur skeletons and few eggs. Everything else was stolen from Mongolian people and taken all around the world. Little disappointed we pay a visit in the temple. Everything looks like it was left in the middle ages.

And then again, next temple with big Buddha statue. No grass is cut, no flowers grown, pidgeons everywhere. Not up to our standards. We enter the temple and take photos incognito, they have oveh 150kg big sumo-like guard that is watching the temple. Thank you for your silent-mode, Nikon.

We stop at Zanabazar's museum which is impressive. And then, shopping spree at State department store, souvenier hunting. We finish at mongolian deserts, and then walk across the city to our hotel.
